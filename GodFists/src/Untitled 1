Ideas:


- make it so everyone can make their own separate ritual each person is limited to one, and a chance increases for them every time they offer. This percentage starts at 100% and is divided 
per each person depending on how much offerings they made?

- Give god fist holder abilities 
	= first ability will be god fist, this is a one hit fist but the user must time attack to land and uses minecraft swing.
	= second ability is flying user will be able to fly unlimitedly but while his god fist cool down is up he can only fly for a certain duration
	= third ability is transmission, ability to teleport to any player and when he does this his god fist cool down is initiated and the x10 damage is applied too.
	= fourth ability is invisibility,
- give players god shield, must time shield block perfectly to block god fist attack
